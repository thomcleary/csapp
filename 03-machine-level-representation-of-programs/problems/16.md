# Problem 16

When given the `C` code

```C
void cond(long a, long *p) {
if (p && a > *p)
    *p = a;
}
```

`GCC` generates the following assembly code:

```asm
# void cond(long a, long *p)
# a in %rdi, p in %rsi
cond:
    testq   %rsi, %rsi
    je      .L1
    cmpq    %rdi, (%rsi)
    jge     .L1
    movq    %rdi, (%rsi)
.L1:
    rep; ret
```

- (a)
  Write a goto version in `C` that performs the same computation and mimics
  the control flow of the assembly code, in the style shown in Figure 3.16(b).
  You might find it helpful to first annotate the assembly code as we have done
  in our examples.

- (b)
  Explain why the assembly code contains two conditional branches, even
  thought the C code has only one if statement.

## Answer

### (a)

```C
void cond_goto(long a, long *p) {
    if (!p) {
        goto done;
    }

    if (*p >= a) {
        goto done;
    }

    *p = a;

    done:
        return;
}
```

### (b)

Because there are 2 conditions to check in the expression of the if statement.
