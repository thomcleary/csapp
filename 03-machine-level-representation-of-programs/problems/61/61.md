# Problem 61

In Section 3.6.6 we examined the following code as a candidate for the use of
conditional data transfer:

```C
long cread(long *xp) {
    return (xp ? *xp : 0);
}
```

We showed a trial implementation using a conditional move instruction but argued
that it was not valid, since it could attempt to read from a null address.

Write a `C` function `cread_alt` that has the same behaviour as `cread`, except
that it can be compiled to use a conditional data transfer. When compiled, the
generated code should use a conditional move instruction rather than one of the
jump instructions.
