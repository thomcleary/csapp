# Problem 47

Running our stack-checking code 10,000 times on a system running Linux version
2.6.16, we obtained addresses ranging from a minimum of 0xffffb754 to a
maximum of 0xffffd754.

- (a) What is the approximate range of addresses?

- (b) If we attempted a buffer overrun with a 128-byte nop sled, about how many
  attempts would it take to test all starting addresses?

## Answers

### (a)

```python
>>> 0xffffd754 - 0xffffb754
8192
```

- 8192 -> 2^13

### (b)

- log2(128) = 7

- 2^(13-7)
- 2^6
- 64 attempts
