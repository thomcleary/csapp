# Problem 17

An alternate rule for translating `if` statements into goto code is as follows:

```C
t = test-expr;
if (t) {
    goto true;
}

else-statement
goto done;

true:
    then-statement;
done:
...
```

- (a)
  Rewrite the goto version of `absdiff_se` based on this alternate rule.

- (b)
  Can you think o any reasons for choosing one rule over the other?

## Answer

### (a)

```C
long gotodiff_se(long x, long y) {
    if (x < y) {
        goto x_lt_y;
    }

    lt_cnt++;
    return y - x;

    x_lt_y:
        ge_cnt++;
        return x - y;
}
```

### (b)

The former rule can be shorter than the one suggested in this question if there is no else statement

```C
if (!condition) {
    goto done;
}
// then statements
// ...
done:
    // ...
```

Rather than

```C
if (condition) {
    goto then;
}
goto done;

then:
    // then statements
    // ...

done:
    // ...
```
