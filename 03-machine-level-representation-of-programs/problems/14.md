# Problem 14

The `C` code

```C
int test(data_t a) {
    return a TEST 0;
}
```

shows a general comparison between argument `a` and 0, where we can set the
data type of the argument by declaring `data_t` with a `typedef`, and the nature
of the comparison by declaring `TEST` with a `#define` declaration. The following
instruction sequences implement the comparison, where `a` is held in some portion
of register `rdi`. For each sequence, determine which data types `data_t` and which
comparison `TEST` could cause the compiler to generate this code.

(There can be multiple correct answers; list all correct ones)

- (a)

```asm
testq   %rdi, %rdi
setge   %al
```

- (b)

```asm
testw   %di, %di
sete    %al
```

- (c)

```asm
testb   %dil, %dil
seta    %al
```

- (d)

```asm
testl   %edi, %edi
setle   %al
```

## Answer

### (a)

- `data_t` = `long` (setge is a signed instruction)
- `TEST` = `>=`

### (b)

- `data_t` = `short`/`unsigned short`
- `TEST` = `==`

### (c)

- `data_t` = `unsigned char`
- `TEST` = `>`

### (d)

- `data_t` = `int` (setle is a signed instruction)
- `TEST` = `<=`
