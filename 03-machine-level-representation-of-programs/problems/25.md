# Problem 25

For `C` code having the general form

```C
long loop_while2(long a, long b) {
    long result = ???;
    while (???) {
        result = ???;
        b = ???;
    }
    return result;
}
```

`GCC` run with command lone option -O1, produces the following code:

```asm
# a in %rdi, b in %rsi
loop_while2:
    testq   %rsi, %rsi
    jle     .L8
    movq    %rsi, %rax
.L7:
    imulq   %rdi, %rax
    subq    %rdi, %rsi
    testq   %rsi, %rsi
    jg      .L7
    rep; ret
.L8:
    movq    %rsi, %rax
    ret
```

We can see that the compiler used a guarded-do translation, using the `jle`
instruction on line 3 to skip over the loop code when the initial test fails. Fill in
the missing parts of the C code. Note that the control structure in the assembly
code does not exactly match what would be obtained by a direct translation of the
C code according to our translation rules. In particular, it has two different `ret`
instructions (lines 10 and 13). However, you can fill out the missing portions of
the C code in a way that will have equivalent behaviour to the assembly code.

## Answer

```C
long loop_while2(long a, long b) {
    long result = b;
    while (b > 0) {
        result = result * a;
        b = b - a;
    }
    return result;
}
```
