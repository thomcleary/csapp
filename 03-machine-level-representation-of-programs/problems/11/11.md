# Problem 11

It is common to find assembly-code lines of the form

```asm
xorq %rdx,%rdx
```

in code that was generated from `C` where no `EXCLUSIVE-OR` operations were present.

- (a) Explain the effect of this particular XOR instruction and what useful
  operation it implements

- (b) What would be the more straightforward way to express this operation in
  assembly code?

- (c) Compare the number of bytes to encode these two different implementations
  of the same operation

## Answer

### (a)

It sets the value of the register to 0. As both operands are the same register. `x ^ x = 0`

### (b)

Move immediate value 0 into the register

```asm
movq $0, %rdx
```

### (c)

```shell
$ mycc -Og -S xor.c
```

From the assembly output of `xor.c`, we can see that the compiler has turned the expression
like `x = x ^ x;` into `movl $0, %eax` as mentioned in part (b).

Where as the expression `y = y ^ x;` has been compiled to `xorq %rax, %rdx`.
(this will be used to compare byte sizes)

```shell
$ mycc -Og -c xor.c
$ objdump -d xor.o
...
0000000000000000 <main>:
   0:	f3 0f 1e fa          	endbr64
   4:	48 63 d7             	movslq %edi,%rdx
   7:	85 ff                	test   %edi,%edi
   9:	7e 0b                	jle    16 <main+0x16>
   b:	b8 00 00 00 00       	mov    $0x0,%eax
  10:	48 31 c2             	xor    %rax,%rdx
  13:	01 d0                	add    %edx,%eax
  15:	c3                   	ret
  16:	b8 15 cd 5b 07       	mov    $0x75bcd15,%eax
  1b:	eb f3                	jmp    10 <main+0x10>
```

- `xorq` 3 bytes
- `movl` 5 bytes
