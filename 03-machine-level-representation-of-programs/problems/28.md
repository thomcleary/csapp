# Problem 28

A function `fun_b` has the following overall structure:

```C
long fun_b(unsigned long x) {
    long val = 0;
    long i;
    for (...; ...; ...;) {
        .
        .
        .
    }
    return val;
}
```

The `GCC` `C` compiler generates the following assembly code:

```asm
# long fun_b(unsigned long x)
# x in %rdi
fun_b:
    movl    $64, %edx
    movl    $0, %eax
.L10:
    movq    %rdi, %rcx
    andl    $1, %ecx
    addq    %rax, %rax
    orq     %rcx, %rax
    shrq    %rdi
    subq    $1, %rdx
    jne     .L10
    rep; ret
```

Reverse engineer the operation of this code and then do the following:

- (a) Use the assembly code version to fill in the missing parts of the C code
- (b) Explain why there is neither an initial test before the loop nor an initial jump
  to the test portion of the loop
- (c) Describe in English what this function computes

## Answers

### (a)

```C
long fun_b(unsigned long x) {
    long val = 0;
    long i;
    for (i = 64; i != 0; i--;) {
        val += val; // solution uses (val << 1)
        val |= 1 & x;
        x >>= 1;

    }
    return val;
}
```

### (b)

The compiler is able to determine that this loop will always run at least once as the initial expression
`i = 64` passes the test expression `i != 0`. So the initial test is not required.

### (c)

- Reverses the bits in `x` (from solution)
