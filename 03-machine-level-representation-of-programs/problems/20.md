# Problem 20

In the following `C` function, we have left the definition of operation `OP` incomplete:

```C
#define OP ??? /* Unknown operator */

long arith(long x) {
    return x OP 8;
}
```

When compiled, `GCC` generates the following assembly code:

```asm
# long arith(long x)
# x in %rdi
arith:
    leaq    7(%rdi), %rax
    testq   %rdi, %rdi
    cmovns  %rdi, %rax
    sarq    $3, %rax
    ret
```

- (a)
  What operation is `OP`?

- (b)
  Annotate the code to explain how it works

## Answers

### (a)

- `OP` = `/`

### (b)

```asm
# long arith(long x)
# x in %rdi
arith:
    leaq    7(%rdi), %rax   # %rax = x + 7
    testq   %rdi, %rdi      # x & x
    cmovns  %rdi, %rax      # if ~SF (nonnegative) -> %rax = x
    sarq    $3, %rax        # %rax = %rax >> 3 (arithmetic shift)
    ret
```

#### (From solution)

The program creates a temporary value equal to `x+7`,
in anticipation of `x` being negative and therefore requiring biasing.
(see Section 2.3.7)

The `cmovns` instruction conditionally changes this number to `x` when `x≥0`,
and then it is shifted by 3 to generate `x/8`.”
