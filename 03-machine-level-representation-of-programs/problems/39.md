# Problem 39

Use equation 3.1 to explain how the computations of the initial values for `Aptr`,
`Bptr`, and `Bend` in the `C` code from figure 3.37(b) (lines 3-5) correctly describe their
computations in the assembly code generated for `fix_prod_ele` (lines 3-5)

## Equation 3.1 (page 258)

In general, for an array declared as

`T D[R][C];`

array element `D[i][j]` is at memory address

`&D[i][j] = Xd + L(C * i + j)`

where `L` is the size of data type `T` in bytes.

## Optimized `C` code

```C
int *Aptr = &A[i][0]
int *Bptr = &B[i][k]
int *Bend = &B[N][k]
```

## Assembly code

```asm
# int fix_prod_ele_opt(fix_matrix A, fix_matrix B, long i, long k)
# A in %rdi, B in %rsi, i in %rdx, k in %rcx
fix_prod_ele:
    salq    $6, %rdx                # Compute 64i
    addq    %rdx, %rdi              # Compute Aptr = Xa + 64i = &A[i][0]
    leaq    (%rsi,%rcx,4), %rcx     # Compute Bptr = Xb + 4k = &B[0][k]
    leaq    1024(%rcx), %rsi        # Compute Bend = Xb + 4k + 1024 = &B[N][k]
    ...
```

## Answer

### `Aptr`

The `C` code sets `Aptr` to the address of the first element in row `i` of `A`

```C
int *Aptr = &A[i][0]
```

This is calculated in the assembly code by determining the correct offset from the start of `A`, `A[0][0]`, to `A[i][0].

That is, the number of rows (i), multiplied by the number of elements in each row (N) multipled by the size of each `int` element (4).

- `&D[i][j] = Xd + L(C * i + j)`
- `&A[i][0] = A + 4(N * i + 0)`
- `&A[i][0] = A + 4(16i)`
- `&A[i][0] = A + 64i`

```asm
salq    $6, %rdx                # Compute 64i
addq    %rdx, %rdi              # Compute Aptr = Xa + 64i = &A[i][0]
```

### `Bptr`

The `C` code sets `Bptr` to the address of the kth element in the first row of `B`

```C
int *Bptr = &B[0][k]
```

This is calculated in the assembly code by determining the correct offset from the start of the first row of `B` to the kth element.

That is, k multiplied by the size of each element (4)

- `&D[i][j] = Xd + L(C * i + j)`
- `&B[0][k] = B + 4(N * 0 + k)`
- `&B[0][k] = B + 4k`

```asm
leaq    (%rsi,%rcx,4), %rcx     # Compute Bptr = Xb + 4k = &B[0][k]
```

### `Bend`

```C
int *Bend = &B[N][k]
```

This is calculated in the assembly code by determining the correct offset from the first element in `B` to the `N+1`th row at column K of `B` (out of bounds).

That is, the number of rows multipled by the number of elements in each row (N\*N) multiplied by the element size (4), plus the offset to the `kth` element

- `&D[i][j] = Xd + L(C * i + j)`
- `&B[N][k] = B + 4(N * N + k)`
- `&B[N][k] = B + 4(16 * 16 + k)`
- `&B[N][k] = B + 4(256 + k)`
- `&B[N][k] = B + 1024 + 4k`

```asm
leaq    1024(%rcx), %rsi        # Compute Bend = Xb + 4k + 1024 = &B[N][k]
```
