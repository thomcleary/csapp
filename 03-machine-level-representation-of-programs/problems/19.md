# Problem 19

Running on an older processor model, our code required around 16 cycles when
the branching pattern was highly predictable, and around 31 cycles when the
pattern was random.

- (a)
  What is the approximate miss penalty?

- (b)
  How many cycles would the function require when the branch is mispredicted?

## Answers

### (a)

- Miss Penalty = 2(Trand - Tok) = 2(31-16) = 30

### (b)

- Cycles when branch is mispredicted
  - Cycles when predicted + miss penalty
  - 16 + 30 = 46
