# Problem 45

Answer the following for the structure declaration

```C
struct {
    char *a;
    short b;
    double c;
    char d;
    float e;
    char f;
    long g;
    int h;
} rec;
```

- (a) What are the byte offsets of all the fields in the structure?
- (b) What is the total size of the structure?
- (c) Rearrange the fields of the structure to minimize wasted space, and then
  show the byte offsets and total size for the rearranged structure

## Answers

### (a) & (b)

| a   | b   | c                | d   | e                | f   | g              | h   | Total size             |
| --- | --- | ---------------- | --- | ---------------- | --- | -------------- | --- | ---------------------- |
| 0   | 8   | 10+6padding = 16 | 24  | 25+3padding = 28 | 32  | 33+7padding=40 | 48  | 52+4padding = 56 bytes |

- End of structure must be padded with 4bytes to satisfy the 8 byte alignment requirement

### (c)

Largest to smallest, so that 8 byte offsets are created without padding

```C
struct {
    char *a;
    double c;
    long g;
    float e;
    int h;
    short b;
    char d;
    char f;
} rec;
```

| a   | c   | g   | e   | h   | b   | d   | f   | Total size             |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---------------------- |
| 0   | 8   | 16  | 24  | 28  | 32  | 34  | 35  | 36+4padding = 40 bytes |
