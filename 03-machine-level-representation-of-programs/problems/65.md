# Problem 65

The following code transposes the elements of an MxM array, where M is a
constant defined by `#define`

```C
void tranpose(long A[M][M]) {
    long i,j;
    for (i = 0; i < M; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            long t = A[i][j];
            A[i][j] = A[j][i];
            A[j][i] = t;
        }
    }
}
```

When compiled with optimisation level `-O1`, `GCC` generates the following code
for the inner loop of the function:

```asm
.L6:
    movq    (%rdx), %rcx
    movq    (%rax), %rsi
    movq    %rsi, (%rdx)
    movq    %rcx, (%rax)
    addq    $8, %rdx
    addq    $120, %rax
    cmpq    %rdi, %rax
    jne     .L6
```

We can see that `GCC` has converted the array indexing to pointer code.

- (a) Which register holds a pointer to array element `A[i][j]`?

- (b) Which register holds a pointer to array element `A[j][i]`

- (c) What is the value of `M`?

## Answers

```asm
.L6:
    movq    (%rdx), %rcx    # rcx = *rdx
    movq    (%rax), %rsi    # rsi = *rax
    movq    %rsi, (%rdx)    # *rdx = rsi
    movq    %rcx, (%rax)    # *rax = rcx
    addq    $8, %rdx        # rdx += 8
    addq    $120, %rax      # rax += 120
    cmpq    %rdi, %rax      # rax - rdi
    jne     .L6             # if rax != 0: goto L6
```

### (a)

- `%rdx`
  Since each iteration of the loop increases the pointer by a column, so +8 bytes
  (`addq    $8, %rdx`)

### (b)

- `%rax`
  Since each iteration of the loop increases the pointer by a row, so +120 bytes
  (`addq    $120, %rax`)

### (c)

- M: 15

Can see that sizeof each row is 120 bytes, and each element is 8 bytes

- 120/8 = 15
