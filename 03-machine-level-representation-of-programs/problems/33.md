# Problem 33

A `C` function `procprob` has four arguments `u`, `a`, `v`, and `b`. Each is either a signed
number or a pointer to a signed number, where the numbers have different sizes.
The function has the following body:

```C
*u += a;
*v += b;
return sizeof(a) + sizeof(b);
```

It compiles to the following x86-64 code:

```asm
procprob:
  movslq    %edi, %rdi
  addq      %rdi, (%rdx)
  addb      %sil, (%rcx)
  movl      $6, %eax
  ret
```

Determine a valid ordering and types of the four parameters. There are two
correct answers.

## Answer

- `movl $6, %eax` means `return sizeof(a) + sizeof(b)` returns 6 bytes
- So one is 4 bytes and the other is 2 bytes (`int` and `short`)

- `movslq %edi, %rdi` means the first argument is a 4 byte value (`int`)
- `addq %rdi, (%rdx)` means the third argument is a pointer to an 8 byte value
- `addb %sil, (%rcx)` means the second argument's lowest byte is used to update the 2 byte value pointed to by the 4th argument
  - Since the return value is 6 bytes and `%rdi` is 4 bytes, `%rsi` must be 2 bytes (short)
- `%rdi` and `%rsi` (first and second arguments) must be `a` and `b`
- `%rdx` and `%rcx` must be `u` and `v`

So

- Order 1: a (int), b (short), u (long \*), v (char \*)
- Order 2: b (int), a (short), v (long \*), u (char \*)
