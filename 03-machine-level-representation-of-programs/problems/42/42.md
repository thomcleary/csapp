# Problem 42

The following code shows the declaration of a structure of type `ELE` and the
prototype for a function `fun`:

```C
struct ELE {
    long v;
    struct ELE *p;
};

long fun(struct ELE *ptr);
```

When the code for `fun` is compiled, `GCC` generates the following assembly
code:

```asm
# long fun(struct ELE *ptr)
# ptr in %rdi
fun:
    movl    $0, %eax
    jmp     .L2
.L3:
    addq    (%rdi), %rax
    movq    8(%rdi), %rdi
.L2:
    testq   %rdi, %rdi
    jne     .L3
    rep; ret
```

- (a) Use your reverse engineering skills to write C code for `fun`

- (b) Describe the data structure that this structure imlpements and the operation
  performed by `fun`.

## Answers

### (a)

See `main.c`

### (b)

`ELE` is a linked list of long integers.
`fun` sums the values of each element in the list.
