# Problem 49

In this problem, we will explore the logic behind the code in lines 5-11 of
Figure 3.43(b), where space is allocated for variable-szie array `p`. As the annotations
of the code indicate, let `s1` denote the address of the stack pointer after executing
the `subq` instruction of line 4. This instruction allocates the space for local
variable `i`. Let `s2` denote the value of the stack pointer after executng the `subq`
instruction of line 7. This instruction allocates the storage for local array `p`. Finally,
let `p` denote the value assigned to registers `%r8` and `%rcx` in the instructions of lines
10-11. Both of these registers are used to reference array `p`.

The right-hand side of Figure 3.44 diagrams the positions of the locations
indicated by `s1`, `s2`, and `p`. It also shows that there may be an offset of `e2` bytes
between the values of `s2` and `p`. This space will not be used. There may also be an
offset of `e1` bytes between the end of array `p` and the position indicated by `s1`.

- (a) Explain, in mathematical terms, the logic in the computation of `s2` on lines
  5-7. **Hint:** Think about the bit level representation of -16 and its effect in
  the `andq` instruction on line 6.

- (b) Explain, in mathematical terms, the logic in the computation of `p` on lines
  8-10. **Hint:** You may want to refer to the discussion on division by powers
  of 2 in Section 2.3.7.

- (c) For the following values of `n` and `s1`, trace the execution of the code to
  determine what the resulting values would be for `s2`, `p`, `e1`, and `e2`

| `n` | `s1` | `s2` | `p` | `e1` | `e2` |
| --- | ---- | ---- | --- | ---- | ---- |
| 5   | 2065 |      |     |      |      |
| 6   | 2064 |      |     |      |      |

- (d) What alignment properties does this code guarantee for the values of `s2`
  and `p`?

## Answers

### (a)

```asm
5   leaq    22(,%rdi,8), %rax   # rax = 22 + 8n
6   andq    $-16, %rax          # rax = rax & -16
7   subq    %rax, %rsp          # rsp = rsp - rax (Allocate space for array p (%rsp = s2))
```

- rax = 8n + 22
- rax = (22 + 8n) & -16
- rax = (22 + 8n) & 0xFFFFFFF0

rax gets rounded down to nearest multiple of 16 since the bits less than 2^4 are 0

### (b)

```asm
8   leaq    7(%rsp), %rax       # rax = rsp + 7
9   shrq    $3, %rax            # rax = rax / 8
10  leaq    0(,%rax,8), %r8     # r8 = rax * 8 (Set %r8 to &p[0])
```

%rsp = s2

- rax = rsp + 7
- rax = rax >> 3 (rax / 8)
- r8 = rax \* 8

This removes the lower 3 bits from the stack pointer. effectively rounding it down to the
nearest multiple of 8

### (c)

| `n` | `s1` | `s2` | `p`  | `e1` (s1 - p - (n \* 8)) | `e2` (p - s2) |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| 5   | 2065 | 2017 | 2024 | 1                        | 7             |
| 6   | 2064 | 2000 | 2000 | 16                       | 0             |

#### n = 5

Determine size of space to allocate for `p`

- rax = 22 + 8(5) = 62
- rax = -16 & 62
-     = 0xF0 & 0x3D
      = 11110000 & 00111110
      = 00110000
      = 48 = 0x30

Allocate space for `p` by setting `%rsp` to `s2`

- rsp = rsp (s1) - rax
-          = 2065 - 48 = 2017
- rsp (s2) = 2017

Get address of `p`

- rax = rsp + 7
-     = 2017 + 7
      = 2024
- rax = rax >> 3
-     = 2024 / 8
      = 253
- r8 = rax \* 8 = 2024 = `p`

- e1 = s1 - p - (n \* 8)
  - Space between s1 and p, minus the size of p
- = 2065 - 2024 - 40
  = 1

- e2 = 2024 - 2017
- = 7

#### n = 6

Determine size of space to allocate for `p`

- rax = 22 + 8(6) = 70
- rax = -16 & 70
-     = 0xF0 & 0x46
      = 11110000 & 01000110
      = 01000000
      = 64 = 0x40

Allocate space for `p` by setting `%rsp` to `s2`

- rsp = rsp (s1) - rax
-          = 2064 - 64 = 2000
- rsp (s2) = 2000

Get address of `p`

- rax = rsp + 7
-     = 2000 + 7
      = 2007
- rax = rax >> 3
-     = 2007 / 8
      = 250
- r8 = rax \* 8 = 2000 = `p`

### (d)

`s2` is computed in a way that preserves whatever offset `s1` has
with the nearest multiple of 16

- `2065 - 2017 = 48 = 3 * 16`

`p` will be aligned on a multiple of 8, as is recommended for an array of 8-byte elements
