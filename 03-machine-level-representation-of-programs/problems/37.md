# Problem 37

Suppose `Xs`, the address of short integer array `S`, and long integer index `i` are stored
in registers `%rdx` and `%rcx` respectively. For each of the following expression, give
its type, a forumla for its value, and an assembly-code implementation. The result
should be stored in register `%rax` if it is a pointer and register `%ax` if it has
data type `short`.

| Expression | Type | Value | Assembly code |
| ---------- | ---- | ----- | ------------- |
| `S+1`      | ???  | ???   | ???           |
| `S[3]`     | ???  | ???   | ???           |
| `&S[i]`    | ???  | ???   | ???           |
| `S[4*i+1]` | ???  | ???   | ???           |
| `S+i-5`    | ???  | ???   | ???           |

## Answer

| Expression | Type     | Value             | Assembly code                 |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `S+1`      | short \* | Xs + 2            | leaq 2(%rdx), %rax            |
| `S[3]`     | short    | M[Xs + 6]         | movw 6(%rdx), %ax             |
| `&S[i]`    | short \* | Xs + 2i           | leaq (%rdx, %rcx, 2), %rax    |
| `S[4*i+1]` | short    | M[Xs + 2(4i + 1)] | movw 2(%rdx, %rcx, 8), %ax    |
| `S+i-5`    | short \* | Xs + 2i - 10      | leaq -10(%rdx, %rcx, 2), %rax |
