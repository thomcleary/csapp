# Problem 4

Assume variables `sp` and `dp` are declared with types

```C
src_t *sp;
dest_t *dp;
```

where `src_t` and `dest_t` are data types declared with `typedef`. We wish to use
the appropriate pair of data movement instructions to implement the operation

```C
*dp = (dest_t) *sp;
```

Assume that the values of `sp` and `dp` are stored in registers `%rdi` and `%rsi`,
respectively. For each entry in the table, show the two instructions that implement
the specified data movement. The first instruction in the sequence should read
from memory, do the appropriate conversion, and set the appropriate portion of
register `%rax`. The second instruction should then write the appropriate portion
of `%rax` to memory. In both cases, the portions may be `%rax`, `%eax`, `%ax` or `%al`,
and they may differ from one another.

Recall that when performing a cast that involves both a size change and a
change of "signedness" in C, the operation should change the size first (Section 2.2.6)

1. `src_t`=`long`, `dest_t`=`long`

```asm
movq (%rdi), %rax
movq %rax, (%rsi)
```

2. `src_t`=`char`, `dest_t`=`int`
3. `src_t`=`char`, `dest_t`=`unsigned`
4. `src_t`=`unsigned char`, `dest_t`=`long`
5. `src_t`=`int`, `dest_t`=`char`
6. `src_t`=`unsigned`, `dest_t`=`unsigned char`
7. `src_t`=`char`, `dest_t`=`short`

## Answers

2. `src_t`=`char`, `dest_t`=`int`

```asm
movsbl (%rdi), %eax ; Convert char to int
movl %eax, (%rsi)   ; Store 4 bytes
```

3. `src_t`=`char`, `dest_t`=`unsigned`

This is a conversion from `signed` to `unsigned` and from a smaller to larger size.
The change in size is performed first, which means the sign bit of the smaller one is preserved,
and then reinterpreted when casted to the `unsigned` type.

- Which is why `movsbl` is used instead of `movzbl`

```asm
movsbl (%rdi), %eax
movl %eax, (%rsi)
```

4. `src_t`=`unsigned char`, `dest_t`=`long`

```asm
movzbq (%rdi), %rax ; solution uses movzbl (%rdi), %eax (implicit zero extension of upper 4 bytes of %rax)
movq %rax, (%rsi)
```

5. `src_t`=`int`, `dest_t`=`char`

```asm
movl (%rdi), %eax
movb %al, (%rsi)
```

6. `src_t`=`unsigned`, `dest_t`=`unsigned char`

```asm
movl (%rdi), %eax
movb %al, (%rsi)
```

7. `src_t`=`char`, `dest_t`=`short`

```asm
movsbw (%rdi), %ax
movw %ax, (%rsi)
```
