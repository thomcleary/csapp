# Problem 46

Figure 3.41 shows a (low-quality) implementation of a function that reads a line
from standard input, copies the string to newly allocated storage, and returns a
pointer to the result.

## C code

```C
/* This is very low-quality code.
   It is intended to illustrate bad programming practices.
*/
char *get_line() {
    char buf[4];
    char *result;
    gets(buf);
    result = malloc(strlen(buf));
    strcpy(result, buf);
    return result;
}
```

## Disassembly up through call to `gets`

```asm
# char *get_line()
0000000000400720 <get_line>:
  400720: 53                    push    %rbx
  400721: 48 83 ec 10           sub     $0x10,%rsp
  # Diagram stack at this point
  400725: 48 89 e7              mov     %rsp,%rdi
  400728:   e8 72 ff ff ff      callq   4006a0  <gets>
  # Modify diagram to show stack contents at this point
```

Consider the following scenario. Procedure `get_line` is called with the return
address equal to `0x400076` and register `%rbx` equal to `0x0123456789ABCDEF`. You
type in the string

- `0123456789012345678901234`

The program terminates with a segmentation fault. You run `GDB` and determine
that the error occurs during the execution of the `ret` instruction of `get_line`.

## (a)

Fill in the diagram that follows indicating as much as you can about the stack
just after executing the instruction at line 3 in the disassembly. Label the
quantities stored on the stack (e.g. "Return address") on the right, and their
hexadecimal values (if known) within the box. Each box represents 8 bytes.
Inidicate the position of `%rsp`. Recall that the ASCII codes for characters 0-9
are 0x30-0x39.

| Value                   | Label          |
| ----------------------- | -------------- |
| 00 00 00 00 00 40 00 76 | Return Address |
|                         |                |
|                         |                |
|                         |                |
|                         |                |

## (b)

Modify your diagram to show the effect of the call to `gets` (line 5)

## (c)

To what address does the program attempt to return?

## (d)

What register(s) have corrupted value(s) when `get_line` returns?

## (e)

Besides the potential buffer overflow, what two other things are wrong
with the code for `get_line`?

## Answers

### (a)

| Value                   | Label                      | Stack Pointer |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------- |
| 00 00 00 00 00 40 00 76 | Return Address             |               |
| 01 23 45 67 89 AB CD EF | %rbx                       |               |
| ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? | (unused space)             |               |
| ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? | (4 unused space) + (4 buf) | %rsp          |
|                         |                            |               |

### (b)

| Value                   | Label                      | Stack Pointer |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------- |
| 00 00 00 00 00 40 00 34 | Return Address             |               |
| 33 32 31 30 39 38 37 36 | %rbx                       |               |
| 35 34 33 32 31 30 39 38 | (unused space)             |               |
| 37 36 35 34 33 32 31 30 | (4 unused space) + (4 buf) | %rsp          |
|                         |                            |               |

### (c)

The program attempts to return to `0x400034` instead of `0x400076`

### (d)

`%rbx` has been corrupted

- From: `0x0123456789ABCDEF`
- To: `0x3332313039383736`

### (e)

1. `malloc` is called with `strlen(buf)`

- It should be called with `sizeof(buf)`
- It is unknown if `strlen` will return 0, 1, 2, 3 (or never return if none of the bytes are `'\0'`), depending on
  the initial values of the memory pointed to by `buf`

2. `malloc` may return `NULL` if there is no space left, this is not checked for.
