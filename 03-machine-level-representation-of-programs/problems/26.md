# Problem 26

A function `fun_a` has the following overall structure:

```C
long fun_a(unsigned long x) {
    long val = 0;
    while (...) {
        .
        .
        .
    }
    return ...;
}
```

The `GCC` `C` compiler generates the following assembly code:

```asm
# long fun_a(unsigned long x)
# x in %rdi
fun_a:
    movl    $0, %eax
    jmp     .L5
.L6:
    xorq    %rdi, %rax
    shrq    %rdi            # Shift right by 1
.L5:
    testq   %rdi, %rdi
    jne     .L6
    andl    $1, %eax
    ret
```

Reverse engineer the operation of this code and then do the following:

- (a) Determine what loop translation method was used
- (b) Use the assembly code version to fill in the missing parts of the C code
- (c) Describe in English what this function computes

## Answer

### (a)

Jump-to-middle

### (b)

```C
long fun_a(unsigned long x) {
    long val = 0;
    while (x > 0) {
        val ^= x
        x >>= 1;
    }
    return 1 & val;
}
```

### (c)

- Returns 1 if there are an odd number of 1 bits in x
- Returns 0 if there are an even number of 1 bits in x
- (Parity of x)
