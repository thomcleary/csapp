# Problem 15

In the following excerpts from a disassembled binary, some of the information has
been replaced by X's. Answer the following questions about these instructions.

- (a)
  What is the target of the `je` instruction below? (You do not need to know
  anything about the `callq` instruction here.)

```asm
4003fa: 74 02       je      XXXXXX
4003fc: ff d0       callq   *%rax
```

- (b)
  What is the target of the `je` instruction below?

```asm
40042f: 74 f4       je      XXXXXX
400431: 5d          pop     %rbp
```

- (c)
  What is the address of the `ja` and `pop` instructions?

```asm
XXXXXX: 77 02       ja      400547
XXXXXX: 5d          pop     %rbp
```

- (d)
  In the code that follows, the jump target is encoded in PC-relative form as a
  4-byte two's-complement number. The bytes are listed from least signficant to
  most, reflecting the little-endian byte ordering of x86-64. What is the address
  of the jump target?

```asm
4005e8: e9 73 ff ff ff      jmpq    XXXXXX
4005ed: 90                  nop
```

## Answers

### (a)

- Target = `4003fc` + `0x2` = `4003fe`

### (b)

- Target = `400431` + `f4`
- = `400431` + `11110100`
- = `400431` - `(00001011 + 1)` (invert bits and add 1 to get inverse)
- = `400431 - 0xC`
- = `400425`

### (c)

- pop address = `0x400547 - 0x2` = `0x400545`
- ja address = pop address - (1 \* 2) = `0x400543`
  - (1 \* 2), move back 1 byte for each byte of the `ja` instruction

### (d)

- Target = `0x4005ed` + `1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 0111 0011`
- = `0x4005ed` - `0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1000 1100` + `1`
- =`0x4005ed` - `0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1000 1101`
- =`0x4005ed` - `0x8d`
- = `0x400560`
