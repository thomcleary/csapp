# Problem 3

Each of the following lines of code generates an error message when we invoke
the assembler. Explain what is wrong with each line.

1. `movb $(0xF), (%ebx)`
2. `movl %rax, (%rsp)`
3. `movw (%rax), 4(%rsp)`
4. `movb %al, %sl`
5. `movq %rax, $0x123`
6. `movl %eax, %dx`
7. `movb %si, 8(%rbp)`

## Answers

1. `%ebx` is is a 32bit register, but referencing memory should be done with 64bits.
   However, stackoverflow posts seem to suggest this is actually legal

2. `movl` requires source operand to be 32bit, however `%rax` is 64bit

3. Both operands cannot be memory addresses.

4. `%sl` is not a valid register

5. `$0x123` is an immediate value, not a register or memory address

6. `movl` requires 32bits, but `%dx` is a 16bit register

7. `movb` requires 8bit source, however `%si` is 16bit
