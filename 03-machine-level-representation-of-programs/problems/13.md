# Problem 13

The `C` code

```C
int comp(data_t a, data_t b) {
    return a COMP b;
}
```

shows a general comparison between arguments `a` and `b` where `data_t`, the data
type of the arguments is defined (via `typedef`) to be one of the integer data types
listed in Figure 3.1 (`char`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `char *`, `float`, `double`)
and either signed or unsigned. The comparison `COMP` is defined via `#define`.

Suppose `a` is in some portion of `%rdx` while `b` is in some portion of `%rsi`. For
each of the following instruction sequences determine which data types `data_t`
and which comparisons `COMP` could cause the compiler to generate this code.

(There can be multiple correct answers; you should list them all)

- (a)

```asm
cmpl    %esi, %edi
setl    %al
```

- (b)

```asm
cmpw    %si, %di
setge   %al
```

- (c)

```asm
cmpb    %sil, %dil
setbe   %al
```

- (d)

```asm
cmpq    %rsi, %rdi
setne   %a
```

## Answer

### (a)

- `data_t` = `int`
- `COMP` = `<`

### (b)

- `data_t` = `short`
- `COMP` = `>=`

### (c)

- `data_t` = `unsigned char`
- `COMP` = `<=`

### (d)

- `data_t` = `long`/`unsigned long` or pointer to some type, e.g. `long *`
- `COMP` = `!=`
