# Problem 29

Executing a `continue` statement in `C` causes the program to jump to the end of
the current loop iteration. The stated rule for translating a `for` loop into a `while`
loop needs some refinement when dealing with `continue` statements. For example,
consider the following code:

```C
/* Example of for loop containing a continue statement */
/* Sum even numbers between 0 and 9 */
long sum = 0;
long i;
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i & 1) {
        continue;
    }
    sum += 1;
}
```

- (a) What would we get if we naively applied our rule for translating the `for` loop
  into a `while` loop? What would be wrong with this code?

- (b) How could you replace the `continue` statement with a `goto` statement to
  ensure that the `while` loop correctly duplicates the behaviour of the `for` loop?

## Answers

### (a)

```C
long sum = 0;
long i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
    if (i & 1) {
        continue;
    }
    sum += 1;
    i++;
}
```

You would create an infinite loop, as `i` won't be incremented.

### (b)

```C
long sum = 0;
long i = 0;

while (i < 10) {
    if (i & 1) {
        goto inc;
    }

    sum += 1;

    inc:
        i++;
}
```
