# Problem 9

Suppose we want to generate assembly code for the following C function:

```C
long shift_left4_rightn(long x, long n) {
    x <<= 4;
    x >>= n;
    return x;
}
```

The code that follows is a portion of the assembly code that performs the
actual shifts and leaves the final value in register `%rax`. Two key instructions
have been omitted. Parameters `x` and `n` are stored in registers `%rdi` and `%rsi`,
respectively.

```asm
# long shift_left4_rightn(long x, long n)
# x in %rdi, n in %rsi
shift_left4_rightn:
    movq    %rdi, %rax  # Get x
    # ???               # x <<= 4
    movl    %esi, %ecx  # Get n (4 bytes)
    # ???               # x >>= n
```

Fill in the missing instructions, following the annotations on the right. The
right shift should be performed arithmetically.

## Answer

```asm
# long shift_left4_rightn(long x, long n)
# x in %rdi, n in %rsi
shift_left4_rightn:
    movq    %rdi, %rax  # Get x
    shlq    $4, %rax    # x <<= 4
    movl    %esi, %ecx  # Get n (4 bytes)
    sarq    %cl, %rax   # x >>= n
```
