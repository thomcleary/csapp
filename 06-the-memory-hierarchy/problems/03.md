# Problem 3

Estimate the average time (in ms) to access a sector on the following disk

| Parameter                           | Value      |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Rotational rate                     | 15,000 RPM |
| Time of average seek                | 8 ms       |
| Average number of sectors per track | 500        |

## Answer

- Estimated time of access = (Time of average seek) + (Time of average rotation) + (Time of average transfer)

- Time of max rotation = (60 seconds \* 1000ms) / 15,000 RPM) = 4ms
- Time of average rotation = 1/2 \* 4ms = 2ms

- Time of average transfer = (60 seconds _ 1000ms) / (15,000 RPM _ 500 tracks)
- = 60,000 / 7,500,000 = 0.08ms

- Estimated time = 8ms + 2ms + 0.08ms
- ~ 10ms
