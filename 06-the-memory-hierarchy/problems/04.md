# Problem 4

Suppose that a 1MB file consisting of 512-byte logical blocks is stored on a disk
drive with the following characteristics:

| Parameter                           | Value      |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Rotational rate                     | 10,000 RPM |
| Time of average seek                | 5ms        |
| Average number of sectors per track | 1,000      |
| Surfaces                            | 4          |
| Sector size                         | 512 bytes  |

For each case below suppose that a program reads the logical blocks of the
file sequentially, one after the other, and that the time to position the head over
the first block is (Time of average seek + Time of average rotation)

- (a) Best case: Estimate the optimal time (in ms) required to read the file given
  the best possible mapping of logical blocks to disk sectors (ie sequential)

- (b) Random case: Estimate the time (in ms) required to read the file if blocks
  are mapped randomly to disk sectors

## Answers

- The number of sectors to read is 1MB / 512
- (2^20) / 512 = 2048 sectors

### (a)

- Require 2 full rotations to read ~2000 sectors from 2 tracks 1000 sectors in size
- Time of average seek + Time of average rotation + (2 \* Time of max rotation)
- Time of average seek = 5ms
- Time of max rotation = 60,000 / 10,000 = 6ms
- Time of average rotation = 1/2 \* 6ms = 3ms
- Estimate = 5ms + 3ms + (2 \* 6ms)
- = 5ms + 3ms + 12ms = 20ms

### (b)

- Potentially each of the 2048 sectors require the average seek and rotation
- Transfer time is negligible
- 2048 \* (5ms + 3ms)
- ~ 16,384ms
