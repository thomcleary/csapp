# Problem 10

In the previous `dotprod` example, what fraction of the total references to `x` and `y`
will be hits once we have padded array `x`?

## Answer

- 8 loop iterations
- 2 reads per loop
- 16 cache potential hits/misses

- Loop 1: 2 misses, but x[0-3] stored in Set 0 and y[0-3] stored in Set 1
- Loop 2: 2 hits
- Loop 3: 2 hits
- Loop 4: 2 hits
- Loop 5: 2 misses, but x[4-7] stored in Set 1and y[4-7] stored in Set 0
- Loop 6: 2 hits
- Loop 7: 2 hits
- Loop 8: 2 hits

- 12 / 16 cache hits
