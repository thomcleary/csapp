# Problem 5

As we have seen, a potential drawback of SSDs is that the underlying flash memory
can wear out. For example, the SSD in Figure 6.14, Intel guarantees about
128 petabytes (128 \* 10^15 bytes) of writes before the drive wears out. Given
this assumption, estimate the lifetime (in years) of this SSD for the following
workloads:

- (a) Worst case for sequential writes: The SSD is written to continuously at a rate
  of 470 MB/s (the average sequential write throughput of the device)

- (b) Worst case for random writes: The SSD is written to continuously at a rate
  of 303 MB/s (the average random write throughput of the device)

- (c) Average case: The SSD is written to at a rate of 20 GB/day (the average
  daily write rate assumed by some computer manufacturers in their mobile
  computer workload simulations)

## Answers

- Write limit in bytes = 128,000,000,000,000,000 bytes

### (a)

- 470MB = (470 \* 10^6) = 470,000,000 bytes
- Total seconds = Write limit / 470,000,000 = ~272,340,425 seconds
- Total years = 272,340,425 / 60 / 60 / 24 / 365
- ~ 8.6 years

### (b)

- 303MB = (303 \* 10^6) = 303,000,000 bytes
- Total seconds = Write limit / 303,000,000 = ~422,442,244 seconds
- Total years = 422,442,244 / 60 / 60 / 24 / 365
- ~ 13.4 years

### (c)

- 128,000,000,000,000,000 / (20 \* 10^9)
- 128,000,000,000,000,000 / 20,000,000,000
- 6,400,000 days
- ~17,535 years
