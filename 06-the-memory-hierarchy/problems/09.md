# Problem 9

The following table gives the parameters for a number of different caches. For
each cache, determine the number of cache sets (S), tag bits (t), set index bits (s),
and block offset bits (b).

| Cache | m   | C    | B   | E   | S   | t   | s   | b   |
| ----- | --- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.    | 32  | 1024 | 4   | 1   |     |     |     |     |
| 2.    | 32  | 1024 | 8   | 4   |     |     |     |     |
| 3.    | 32  | 1024 | 32  | 32  |     |     |     |     |

## Answer

| Cache | m   | C    | B   | E   | S   | t   | s   | b   |
| ----- | --- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.    | 32  | 1024 | 4   | 1   | 256 | 22  | 8   | 2   |
| 2.    | 32  | 1024 | 8   | 4   | 32  | 24  | 5   | 3   |
| 3.    | 32  | 1024 | 32  | 32  | 1   | 27  | 0   | 5   |
