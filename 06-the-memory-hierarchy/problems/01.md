# Problem 1

In the following, let `r` be the number of rows in a DRAM array, `c`, the number of
columns, `bR` the number of bits needed to address the rows and `bC` the number of
bits needed to address the columns. For each of the following DRAMs, determine
the power-of-2 array dimensions that minimize max(bR, bC), the maximum number
of bits needed to address the rows or columns of the array

| Organisation | r   | c   | bR  | bC  | max(bR, bC) |
| ------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | ----------- |
| 16 x 1       |     |     |     |     |             |
| 16 x 4       |     |     |     |     |             |
| 128 x 8      |     |     |     |     |             |
| 512 x 4      |     |     |     |     |             |
| 1024 x 4     |     |     |     |     |             |

## Answer

| Organisation | r   | c   | bR  | bC  | max(bR, bC) |
| ------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | ----------- |
| 16 x 1       | 4   | 4   | 2   | 2   | 2           |
| 16 x 4       | 4   | 4   | 2   | 2   | 2           |
| 128 x 8      | 16  | 8   | 4   | 3   | 4           |
| 512 x 4      | 32  | 16  | 5   | 4   | 5           |
| 1024 x 4     | 32  | 32  | 5   | 5   | 5           |
