# Problem 8

The three functions in Figure 6.20 perform the same operation with varying degrees
of spatial locality. Rank-order the functions with respect to the spatial locality
enjoyed by each. Explain how you arrived at your ranking.

## Answer

1. `clear1`: clears an entire point at a time, in "sequential order" with respective to its memory layout
2. `clear2`: poor spatial locality, jumps between the two arrays of point while clearing
3. `clear3`: poorest spatial locality, loops over the jth element of each point's array rather than clearing a single point
