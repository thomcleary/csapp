# Problem 12

The problems that follow will help reinforce your understanding of how caches
work. Assume the following:

- The memory is byte addressable
- Memory accesses are to 1 byte words (not to 4-byte words)
- Addresses are 13 bits wide
- Cache is 2 way set associative (E = 2)
- 4 byte block size (B = 4)
- 8 sets (S = 8)

The following table shows the format of an address (1 bit ber cell). Indicate
(by labelling the table) the fields that would be used to determine the following:

- CO: The cache block offset
- CI: The cache set index
- CT: The cache tag

| 12  | 11  | 10  | 9   | 8   | 7   | 6   | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   | 0   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

## Answer

| 12  | 11  | 10  | 9   | 8   | 7   | 6   | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   | 0   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CT  | CT  | CT  | CT  | CT  | CT  | CT  | CT  | CI  | CI  | CI  | CO  | CO  |

- m = 13
- s = 3
- b = 2
- t = m - (s + b) = 13 - 5 = 8
