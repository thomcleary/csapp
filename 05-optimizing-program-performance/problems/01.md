# Problem 1

The following problem illustrates the way memory aliasing can cause unexpected
program behaviour. Consider the following procedure to swap two values:

```C
/* Swap value x at xp with value y at yp */
void swap(long *xp, long *yp)
{
    *xp = *xp + *yp; // x+y
    *yp = *xp - *yp; // x+y-y = x
    *xp = *xp - *yp; // x+y-x = y
}
```

If this procedure is called with `xp` equal to `yp`, what effect will it have?

## Answer

It will set the value at the memory pointed to by `xp` and `yp` to 0.
