# Problem 12

Write `HCL` code describing a circuit for word inputs `A`, `B`, and `C` selects the
_median_ of the three values. That is, the output equals the word lying between the
minimum and maximum of the three inputs.

## Answer

```C
word Median3 = [
    (A <= B && A >= C) || (A >= B && A <= C)    : A;
    (B <= A && B >= C) || (B >= A && B <= C)    : B;
    1                                           : C;
];
```

## Solution

- Can have multiple cases for the same output.
- Means you don't always have to evaluate all expressions

```C
word Median3 = [
    (A <= B && A >= C)  : A;
    (A >= B && A <= C)  : A;
    (B <= A && B >= C)  : B;
    (B >= A && B <= C)  : B;
    1                   : C;
];
```
