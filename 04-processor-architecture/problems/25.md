# Problem 25

Looking at the memory operations for the different instructions shown in Figures
4.18 to 4.21, we can see that the data for memory writes are always either
`valA` or `valP`. Write `HCL` code for the signal `mem_data` in `SEQ`.

## Answer

```C
word mem_data = [
    icode in { IRMMOVQ, IPUSHQ } : valA;
    icode == ICALL : valP;
];
```
