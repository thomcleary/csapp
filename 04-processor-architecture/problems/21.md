# Problem 21

Register ID `dstM` indicates the destination register for write port `M`, where `valM`,
the value read from the memory is stored. This is shown in Figures 4.18 to 4.21 as the
second step in the write-back stage. Write `HCL` code for `dstM`.

## Answer

```C
word dstM = [
    icode in { IMRMOVQ, POPQ } : rA;
    1 : RNONE;
];
```
