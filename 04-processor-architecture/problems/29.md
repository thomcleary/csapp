# Problem 29

Suppose we could take the system of Figure 4.32 and divide it into an arbitrary
number of pipeline stages `k`, each having a delay of `300 / k`, and with each pipeline
register having a delay of 20ps.

- (a) What would be the latency and the throughput of the system, as functions
  of `k`?

- (b) What would be the ultimate limit on the throughout?

## Answers

### (a)

- Throughput = 1 / (300/k + 20) \* 1000 = 1000 / (300/k + 20)
- Latency = k \* (300 / k + 20) = 20k + 300

### (b)

- 50 GIPs
- as k tends to infinity
- 1000 / (0 + 20) = 50
