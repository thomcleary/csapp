# Problem 8

The following assembly code function lets us determine the behaviour of the
instruction `popq %rsp` for x86-64:

```asm
    .text
.global poptest
poptest:
    movq    %rsp, %rdi      # Save stack pointer
    pushq   $0xabcd         # Push test value
    popq    %rsp            # Pop to stack pointer
    movq    %rsp, %rax      # Set popped value as return value
    movq    %rdi, %rsp      # Restore stack pointer
    ret
```

We find this function always returns `0xabcd`. What does this imply about the
behaviour of `popq %rsp`? What other Y86-64 instruction would have the exact same
behaviour?

## Answer

That `popq %rsp` sets `%rsp` to the value read from memory, not the incremented stack pointer

The other Y86-64 instruction that would have the exact same effect is `mrmovq (%rsp), %rsp`
