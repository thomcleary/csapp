# Problem 7

Let us determine the behaviour of the instruction `pushq %rsp` for an x86-64 processor.
We could try reading the Intel documentation on this instruction, but a
simpler approach is to conduct an experiment on an actual machine. The `C` compiler
would not normall generate this instruction, so we must use hand generated
assembly code for this task. Here is a test function we have written (Web Aside
ASM:EASM on page 178 describes how to write programs that combine C code with
handwritten assembly)

```asm
    .text
.global pushtest
pushtest:
    movq    %rsp, %rax      # Copy stack pointer
    pushq   %rsp            # Push stack pointer
    popq    %rdx            # Pop it back
    subq    %rdx, %rax      # Return 0 or 8
    ret
```

In our experiments, we find that function `pushtest` always returns 0. What
does this imply about the behaviour of the instruction `pushq %rsp` under x86-64?

## Answer

That the original value of `%rsp` is pushed onto the stack before `%rsp` is decremented
