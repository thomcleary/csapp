# Problem 20

The register signal `srcB` indicates which register should be read to generate the
signal `valB`. The desired value is shown as the second step in the decode stage in
Figures 4.18 to 4.21. Write `HCL` code for `srcB`

## Answer

```C
word srcA = [
    icode in { IRMMOVQ, IMRMOVQ, IOPQ } : rA;
    icode in { IPOPQ, IPUSHQ, IRET, ICALL } : RRSP;
    1 : RNONE:
];
```
