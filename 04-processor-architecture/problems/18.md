# Problem 18

Fill in the right hand column of the following table to describe the processing of
the `call` instruction on line 9 of the object code in Figure 4.17

```asm
0x037: 804100000000000000       call proc
```

What effect would this instruction execution have on the registers, the PC,
and the memory?

## Answer

- `%rsp` is set to 120
- `PC` is set to `valC` 0x41, the address of the called function
- `M[120]` is set to the return address `valP` 0x040 (where stack pointer points after this instruction)

### Fetch

- icode:ifun <- M(1)[PC] = M(1)[0x037] = 8:0
- valC <- M(8)[PC + 1] = M(8)[)0x038] = 0x41
- valP <- PC + 9 = 0x040

### Decode

- valB <- R[%rsp] = 128

### Execute

- valE < valB + (-8) = 120

### Memory

- M(8)[valE] <- valP = M(8)[120] <- 0x040

### Write back

- R[%rsp] <- valE = %rsp <- 120

### PC update

- PC <- valC = PC <- 0x41
