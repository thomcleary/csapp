# Problem 24

The conditional move instructions, abbreviated `cmovXX` have instruction code
`IRRMOVQ`. As Figure 4.28 shows, we can implement these instructions by making
use of the `Cnd` signal, generated in the execute stage. Modify the `HCL` code for
`dstE` to implement these instructions

## Answer

```C
word dstE = [
    icode in { IRRMOVQ } && Cnd : rB;
    icode in { IIRMOVQ, IOPQ } : rB;
    icode in { IPUSHQ, IPOPQ, ICALL, IRET } : RRSP;
    1 : RNONE;
];
```
