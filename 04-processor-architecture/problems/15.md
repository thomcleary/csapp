# Problem 15

What would be the effect of the instruction `pushq %rsp` according to the steps
listed in Figure 4.20? Does this conform to the desired behaviour for Y86-64, as
determined in Problem 4.7?

## Answer

- The value of `%rsp` (valE) gets decremented by 8 in the Execute stage (not the register value itself)
- The memory location of valE gets set to the value of `%rsp` (valE-8) in the Memory stage
- `%rsp` is set to valE in the Write back stage

The effect being, the value of the original `%rsp` value is pushed onto the stack. `%rsp` is then decremented.

Y86-64 behaviour states the stack pointer should be decremented before writing.

The steps write before incrementing, however, the effect is the same.
