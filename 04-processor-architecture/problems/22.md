# Problem 22

Only the `popq` instruction uses both register file write ports simultaneously. For
the instruction `popq %rsp`, the same address will be used for both `E` and `M`
write ports, but with different data. To handle this conflict, we must establish a
_priority_ among the two write ports so that when both attempt to write the same
register on the same cycle, only the write from the higher-priority port takes place.
Which of the two ports should be given priority in order to implement the desired
behaviour, as determined in Practice Problem 4.8?

## Answer

The `M` port should be given priority, as in this instance, `%rsp` should be set to the
value of the memory at the orignal `%rsp` not the value of the decremented stack pointer
after the memory read has taken place.
