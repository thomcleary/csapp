# Problem 11

The `HCL` code given for computing the minimum of three words contains four
comparison expressions of the form `X <= Y`.

```C
word Min3 = [
  A <= B && A <= C  : A;
  B <= A && B <= C  : B;
  1                 : C;
];
```

Rewrite the code to compute the same result, but using only three comparisons.

## Answer

```C
word Min3 = [
  A <= B && A <= C  : A;
  B <= C            : B;
  1                 : C;
];
```
