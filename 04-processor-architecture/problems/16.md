# Problem 16

Assume the two register writes in the write-back stage for `popq` occur in the order
listed in Figure 4.20. What would be the effect of executing `popq %rsp`? Does this
conform to the desired behaviour for Y86-64, as determined in Problem 4.8?

## Answer

- `%rsp` is incremented by 8
- `%rsp` is set to the value of the memory at `M[%rsp]` (`%rsp` value before being incremented)
- Executed in this order it will conform to the Y86-64 convention that `popq` should read from memory before incrementing the stack pointer
