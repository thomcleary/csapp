# Problem 7

Write a program called snooze that takes a single command-line argument, calls the `snooze` function from Problem 8.5 with this argument, and then terminates. Write your program so that the user can interrupt the `snooze` function by typing `Ctrl+C` at the keyboard. For example:

```shell
linux> ./snooze 5
CTRL+C
Slept for 3 of 5 secs.
linux>
```
