# Problem 1

Consider three processes with the following starting and ending times:

| Process | Start time | End time |
| ------- | ---------- | -------- |
| A       | 0          | 2        |
| B       | 1          | 4        |
| C       | 3          | 5        |

For each pair of processes, indicate whether they run concurrently (Y) or
not (N):

## Answer
