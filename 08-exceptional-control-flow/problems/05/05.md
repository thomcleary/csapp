# Problem 8

Write a wrapper function for `sleep`, called `snooze` with the following interface:

```C
unsigned int snooze(unsigned int secs);
```

The `snooze` function behaves exactly as the `sleep` function, except that it prints a message describing how long the process actually slept:

```shell
Slept for 4 of 5 secs
```
