# Problem 44

Assume data type `int` is 32 bits long and uses a two's complement representation
for signed values. Right shifts are performed arithmetically for signed values and
logically for unsigned values. The variables are declared and initialized as follows:

```C
int x = foo() /* Arbitrary value */
int y = bar() /* Arbitrary value */

unsigned ux = x;
unsigned uy = y;
```

For each of the following C expressionsm either

- (1) argue that it is true (evaluates to 1) for all values of `x` and `y`
- (2) give values of `x` and `y` for which it is false (evaluates to 0)

- (a) `(x > 0) || (x - 1 < 0)`
- (b) `(x & 7) != 7 || (x << 29 < 0)`
- (c) `(x * x) >= 0`
- (d) `x < 0 || -x <= 0`
- (e) `x > 0 || -x >= 0`
- (f) `x + y == uy + ux`
- (g) `x * ~y + uy * ux == -x`

## Answers

### (a) `(x > 0) || (x - 1 < 0)`

(2): `x = INT_MIN`:

- `INT_MIN > 0` evaluates to 0
- `INT_MIN - 1 < 0` evaluates to 0
  - `INT_MIN - 1` underflows and evaluates to `INT_MAX`

### (b) `(x & 7) != 7 || (x << 29 < 0)`

(1): always true

- `(x & 7) != 7` will evaluate to 1 when `x` has its lowest 3 bits are not all set to 1

  - in this case the entire expression evaluates to `1`

- otherwise, `(x << 29 < 0)` will move the least 3 significant bits of `x` to the most significant 3 bits
- since `x` in this case will always be 7, this will always make the resulting value having a most
  significant bit (sign bit) of 1 (negative), so the expression always evaluates to 1.

### (c) `(x * x) >= 0`

(2): `x = ceil(sqrt(2^31 - 1) = 46341`

- The floor of the sqrt of the largest representable positive two's complement int is the largest
  value of `x` that will evaluate to 1 for the expression `(x * x) >= 0`
- Adding one to that value will result in positive overflow as
  - `(x * x) == INT_MAX`
  - `((x + 1) * (x + 1)) > INT_MAX` (without taking overflow into account)
  - `((x + 1) * (x + 1))` will overflow into a negative value
  - `46341 * 46341 = -2147479015`

### (d) `x < 0 || -x <= 0`

(1): always true

- When `x` is less than 0 the LHS of the expression will return `1`
- When `x` is greater than or equal to 0, the result of the RHS is returned
- The RHS will negate the value of `x` which is positive, so it is possible to represent
  all possible values of `-x` as there is an imbalance between the space of negative and positive
  values in two's complement representation

### (e) `x > 0 || -x >= 0`

(2): `x = INT_MIN`

- When `x` is greater than 0 the LHS will return 1
- When `x` is less than or equal to 0, the result of the RHS is returned
- The RHS will attempt to negate the value of `x` which is 0 or negative
  - However, it is not possible represent the negation of `INT_MIN` in two's complement
    representation
  - The magnitude `|Tmin|` is greater than the magnitude `|Tmax|`

### (f) `x + y == uy + ux`

(1): always true

- `(x + y)` and `uy + ux` will have the same underlying bit representations
- So when compared with `==` `(x + y)` will be promoted to an unsigned integer
- The comparison will always evaluate to 1

### (g) `x * ~y + uy * ux == -x`

(1): always true

- `~y = -y - 1`
- `ux * uy = x * y`
- `x * -y - x + x * y = -x`
- `-xy + xy - x = -x`
- `-x = -x`
