# Problem 33

We can represent a bit pattern of length `w = 4` with a single hex digit. For a two's
complement interpretation of these digits, fill in the following table to determine
the additive inverses of the digits shown.

|       x       |      -x       |
| :-----------: | :-----------: |
| Hex / Decimal | Hex / Decimal |
|    0 / ???    |   ??? / ???   |
|    5 / ???    |   ??? / ???   |
|    8 / ???    |   ??? / ???   |
|    D / ???    |   ??? / ???   |
|    F / ???    |   ??? / ???   |

What do you observe about the bit patterns generated by two's complement
and unsigned (Problem 2.28) negation?

## Answer

|       x       |      -x       |
| :-----------: | :-----------: |
| Hex / Decimal | Hex / Decimal |
|     0 / 0     |     0 / 0     |
|     5 / 5     |    B / -5     |
|    8 / -8     |    8 / -8     |
|    D / -3     |     3 / 3     |
|    F / -1     |     1 / 1     |

The bit patterns are the same, it is just there interpretation that differs.
