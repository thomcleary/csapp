# Problem 54

Assume variables x, f and d are of type int, float and double respectively.
Their values are arbitrary, except that neither f nor d equals +infinity, -infinity or NaN.
For each of the following C expression, either argue that it will always be true
(ie evaluate to 1) or give a value for the variables such that it is not true (ie evaluates to 0)

- (a) `x == (int)(double)x`
- (b) `x == (int)(float)x`
- (c) `d == (double)(float)d`
- (d) `f == (float)(double)f`
- (e) `f == -(-f)`
- (f) `1.0/2 == 1/2.0`
- (g) `d*d >= 0.0`
- (h) `(f+d)-f == d`

## Answers

### (a)

- Always true
- x first casted to double, preserves value
- x casted back to int has value preserved

### (b)

- Can be false
- If x is rounded when cast to float
- e.g. if x is Tmax (maximum two's complement value)

### (c)

- Can be false
- May overflow to +/- infinity as the range of float is smaller

### (d)

- Always true
- First cast to double preserves value of f
- Cast back to float will be a value representable by float

### (e)

- Always true
- This would essentially just be flipping the sign bit

### (f)

- Always true
- The integer denominator and numerator are promoted to double before the expression is computed
- Both expressions are then identical

### (g)

- Always true
- If d is 0, it is equal to 0
- If d is positive multiplication is monotonic so will be > 0
- If d is negative, its square will be positive and > 0

### (h)

- Can be false
- In the cases where (f+d) overflows or underflows to +/- infinity
- infinity - f = infinity != d

- Solution (different example)
  - (1.0e20 + 1.0) - 1.0e20 = 0.0 != 1.0
  - 1.0e20 + 1.0 is rounded to 1.0e20
