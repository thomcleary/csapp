# Problem 26

You are given the assignment of writing a function that determines whether one
string is longer than another. You decide to make use of the string library function
`strlen` having the following declaration:

```C
/* Prototype for library function strlen */
size_t strlen(const char *s);
```

Here is your first attempt at the function:

```C
/* Determine whether string s is longer than string t */
/* WARNING: This function is buggy */
int strlonger(char *s, char *t) {
  return strlen(s) - strlen(t) > 0;
}
```

When you test this on some sample data, things do not seem to work quite
right. You investigate further and determine that, when compiled as a 32-bit
program data type `size_t` is defined (via `typedef`) in header file `stdio.h` to be
`unsigned`.

## (a)

For what case will this function product an incorrect result?

## (b)

Explain how this incorrect result comes about.

## (c)

Show how to fix the code so that it will work reliably.

## Answers

### (a)

When `s` is shorter than `t`

### (b)

This incorrect result happens due to `size_t` being defined as `unsigned`.
It is incapable of representing negative numbers, so the condition `strlen(s) - strlen(t) > 0` will
always be true.

### (c)

```C
/* Determine whether string s is longer than string t */
int strlonger(char *s, char *t) {
  return strlen(s) > strlen(t);
}
```
