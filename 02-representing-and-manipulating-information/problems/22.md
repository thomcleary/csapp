# Problem 22

Show that each of the following bit vectors is a two's complement representation
of `-5` by appling equation 2.3

- (a) `1011`
- (b) `11011`
- (c) `111011`

## Answer

### (a)

- B2T(`1011`) = -1(2^3) + 1(2^0) + 1(2^1) + 0(2^3)
- = -8 + 1 + 2 + 0
- = -5

### (b)

- B2T(`11011`) = -1(2^4) + 1(2^0) + 1(2^1) + 0(2^2) + 1(2^3)
- = -16 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 8
- = -5

### (c)

- B2T(`11011`) = -1(2^5) + 1(2^0) + 1(2^1) + 0(2^2) + 1(2^3) + 1(2^4)
- = -32 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 8 + 16
- = -5
