# Problem 24

Suppose we truncate a 4-bit value (represented by hex digits 0 through F) to a
3 bit value (represented by digits 0 through 7). Fill in the table below showing
the effect of this truncation for some cases, in terms of the unsigned and two's
complement interpretations of those bit patterns.

|         Hex          |       Unsigned       |   Two's complement   |
| :------------------: | :------------------: | :------------------: |
| original / truncated | original / truncated | original / truncated |
|        0 / 0         |       0 / ???        |       0 / ???        |
|        2 / 2         |       2 / ???        |       2 / ???        |
|        9 / 1         |       9 / ???        |       -7 / ???       |
|        B / 3         |       11 / ???       |       -5 / ???       |
|        F / 7         |       15 / ???       |       -1 / ???       |

## Answer

|         Hex          |       Unsigned       |   Two's complement   |
| :------------------: | :------------------: | :------------------: |
| original / truncated | original / truncated | original / truncated |
|        0 / 0         |        0 / 0         |        0 / 0         |
|        2 / 2         |        2 / 2         |        2 / 2         |
|        9 / 1         |        9 / 1         |        -7 / 1        |
|        B / 3         |        11 / 3        |        -5 / 3        |
|        F / 7         |        15 / 7        |       -1 / -1        |
