# Problem 50

SHow how the following binary fractional values would be rounded to the nearest
half (1 bit to the right of the binary point), according to the round-to-even rule.
In each case, show the numeric values, both before and after rounding.

- (a) 10.010
- (b) 10.011
- (c) 10.110
- (d) 11.001

## Answer

### (a) `10.010`

- 2.25
- Half way, rounds to even direction
- Would round down to `10.0` = 2.0

### (b) `10.011`

- 2.375
- Not half way
- Would round up to `10.1` = 2.5

### (c) `10.110`

- 2.75
- Half way, rounds to even direction
- Would round up to `11.0` = 3.0

### (d) `11.001`

- 3.125
- Not half way
- Would round down to `11.0` = 3.0
