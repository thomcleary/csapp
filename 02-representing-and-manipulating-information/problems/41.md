# Problem 41

For a run of ones starting at bit position `n` down to bit position `m` (`n` >= `m`) we saw
that we can generate two forms of code, A and B. How should the compiler decide which form to use?

## Answer

Whichever will result in the smallest number of operations.

When `n = m`, choose form A

- A: `x << n`
- B: `(x << (n + 1)) - (x << n)`;

When `n = m + 1`, choose either:

- A: `(x << n) + (x << m)`
- B: `(x << (n + 1)) - (x << n)`;

When `n < m + 1`, choose form B:

- A: `(x << n) + (x << (n - 1)) + ... + (x << m)`
- B: `(x << (n + 1)) - (x << n)`;

Note: when `m = 0` both forms require 1 fewer shift
