# Problem 48

As mentioned in Problem 2.6 the integer 3,510,593 has hexadecimal representation
0x00359141, while the single precision floating point number 3,510,593.0
has hexadecimal representation 0x4A564504. Derive this floating point representation
and explain the correlation between the bits of the integer and floating point
representations

## Answer

- 3,510,593
- 0x00359141
- 0000_0000_0011_0101_1001_0001_0100_0001
- Most signficant 1 bit is 22nd bit
- 1.1_0101_1001_0001_0100_0001 \* 2^21
- Drop the leading 1 and add 2 trailing 0's to construct the fraction field (23 bits)
- 1_0101_1001_0001_0100_0001_00
- Bias = 2^k - 1 = 2^8 - 1 = 127
- Exponent = exponent_field - bias
- 21 = exponent_field - 127
- exponent_field = 21 + 127 = 148 = 1001_0100
- IEEE Single precision floating point = [sign bit][exponent field][fraction field]
- [0][10010100][10101100100010100000100]
- 01001010010101100100010100000100

All bits trailing the most significant 1 bit of the integer representation will be found
within the fraction field of the single precision floating point representation

- 00000000001`101011001000101000001`
- \_\_010010100`101011001000101000001`00

Just shift the floating point representation to the right by the number of 0 bits padded
to the exponent field when converting (in this case 2)
