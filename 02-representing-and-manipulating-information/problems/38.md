# Problem 38

As we will see in Chapter 3, the `LEA` instruction can perform computations of
the form `(a << k) + b` where `k` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, and `b` is either 0 or some
program value. The compiler often uses this instruction to perform multiplications
by constant factors. For example, we can compute `3 * a` as `(a << 1) + a`.

Consider cases where `b` is either 0 or equal to `a`, and all possible values of `k`,
what multiples of `a` can be computed with a single `LEA` instruction?

## Answer

In the case where `b` is 0:

- All multiples of `a(2^k)` can be computed
- That is `a` times some power of 2

In the case where `b` is equal to `a`:

- All multiples of `a(2^k + 1)` can be computed
- That is `a` times some power of 2 plus 1

So in total we can compute multiples:

- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
