# Problem 43

In the following code, we have omitted the definitions of constants `M` and `N`:

```C
#define M /* Myster number 1 */
#define N /* Mystery number 2 */
int arith(int x, int y) {
  int result = 0;
  result = x * M + y / N; /* M and N are mystery numbers */
  return result;
}
```

We compiled this code for particular values of `M` and `N`. The compiler
optimized the multiplication and division using the methods we have discussed. The
following is a translation of the generated machine code back into C:

```C
/* Translation of assemly code for arith */
int optarith(int x, int y) {
  int t = x;
  x << 5;
  x -= t;
  if (y < 0) y += 7;
  y >>= 3; /* Arithmetic shift */
  return x + y;
}
```

What are the values of `M` and `N`?

## Answer

- M: 31
- N: 8

`x` is being multiplied by M

- is left shifted by 5 in the translated code
- then reduced by `t`, which is equal to `x`
- equivalent to `x * 2^5 - x`
- `x * 32 - x` = `x * 31`
- so `M` is 31

`y` is being divided by `N`

- it has a bias of 7 added when less than 0 (negative)
- and is then right shifted by 3 (division by 8)
- so `N` must be 8
