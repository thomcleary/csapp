# Problem 10

As an application of the property that `a ^ a = 0` for any bit vector `a`, consider the
following program:

```C
void inplace_swap(int *x, int *y) {
  *y = *x ^ *y; /* Step 1 */
  *x = *x ^ *y; /* Step 2 */
  *y = *x ^ *y /* Step 3 */
}
```

As the name implies, we claim that the effect of this procedure is to swap
the values stored at the locations denoted by pointer variables `x` and `y`. Note
that unlike the usual techniques for swapping two values, we do not need a third
location to temporarily store on value while we are moving the other. There is
no performance advantage to this way of swapping; it is merely an itellectual
amusement.

Starting with values `a` and `b` in the locations pointed to by `x` and `y`, respectively,
fill in the table that follows, giving the values stored at the two locations after each
step of the procedure. Use the properties of `^` to show that the desired effect is
achieved. Recall that every element is its own additive inverse (that is `a ^ a = 0`).

| Step      | `*x` | `*y` |
| --------- | ---- | ---- |
| Initially | a    | b    |
| Step 1    | ???  | ???  |
| Step 2    | ???  | ???  |
| Step 3    | ???  | ???  |

## Answer

| Step      | `*x`              | `*y`              |
| --------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Initially | a                 | b                 |
| Step 1    | `a`               | `a ^ b`           |
| Step 2    | `a ^ (a ^ b) = b` | `a ^ b`           |
| Step 3    | `b`               | `b ^ (a ^ b) = a` |
