# Problem 20

Explain how Equation 2.5 applies to the entries in the table you generated when
solving Problem 2.19

## Answer

When `x` was positive (including 0) the signed two's complement interpretation
of `x`'s bit vector was the same as the unsigned interpretation,
`T2U(x) = x` when `x >= 0` (as defined in 2.5).

Where as when `x` was negative the unsigned interpretation of `x`'s bit vector
was `16` less than the unsigned interpretation. As `x`'s size is 4 bits, this
aligns with the equation from 2.5 that says `T2U(x) = x + 2^w` when `x < 0`
(`w` being the number of bits in `x`).
