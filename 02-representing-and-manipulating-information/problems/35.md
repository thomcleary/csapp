# Problem 35

You are given the assignment to develop code for a function `tmult_ok` that will
determine whether two arguments can be multiplied without causing overflow.
Here is your solution:

```C
/* Determine whether arguments can be multiplied without overflow */
int tmult_ok(int x, int y) {
  int p = x * y;
  /* Either x is zero, or dividing p by x gives y */
  return !x || p / x == y;
}
```

You test this code for a number of values of `x` and `y`, and it seems to work
properly. Your coworker challenges you saying, "If I can't use subtraction to test
whether addition has overflowed (see Problem 2.31), then how can you use
division to test whether multiplication has overflowed?"

Devise a mathematical justfication of your approach, along the following
lines. First, argue that the case `x = 0` is handled correctly. Otherwise, consider
`w-bit` numbers `x (x != 0)`, `y`, `p` and `q`, where `p` is the result of performing
two's complement multiplication on `x` and `y`, and `q` is the result of dividing `p` by `x`.

1. Show that `x * y`, the integer product of `x` and `y` can be written in the form
   `x * y = p + t(2^w)`, where `t != 0` if and only if the computation `p` overflows.
2. Show that `p` can be written in the form `p = x * q + r`, where `|r| < |x|`
3. Show that `q = y` if anf only if `r = t = 0`

## Answers

### 1

- w = 8 bits

When `p` overflows

- x = 10 [0000_1010]
- y = 13 [0000_1101]
- x \* y = 130 [1000_0010] -> overflow = -126
- x \* y = 130 = -126 + 2^w = -126 + 2^8 = -126 + 256 = 130

When `p` does not overflow

- x = 10 [0000_1010]
- y = 12 [0000_1100]
- x \* y = 120 [0111_1000]
- x \* y = 120 + t(2^w)
- 10 \* 12 = 120 + t(256)
- 120 = 120 + 256t
- 0 = 256t = t

### 2

- p / x, gives a quotient q and remainder r
- p = x \* q + r, where |r| < |x|

### 3

- If q = y
- Then x \* y = x \* y + r + t(2^w)
- Then r + t(2^w) must be 0
- t(2^w) is only 0 when t is 0
- r + 0 = 0 -> r = 0
- If r = t = 0
- x \* y = x \* q
- x \* y = x \* (p / x)
- x \* y = x \* ((x \* y) / x)
- x \* y = x \* y
- So y = q
