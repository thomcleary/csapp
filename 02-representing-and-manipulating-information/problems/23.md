# Problem 23

Consider the following C functions

```C
int fun1(unsigned word) {
  return (int)((word << 24) >> 24);
}

int fun2(unsigned word) {
  return ((int) word << 24) >> 24;
}
```

Assume these are executed as a 32-bit program on a machine that uses
two's complement arithmetic. Assume also that right shifts of signed values are
performed arithmetically, while right shifts of unisigned values are performed logically.

## (a)

Fill inthe following table showing the effect of these functions for several
example arguments. You will find it more convenient to work with a
hexadecimal representation. Just remember that hex digits 8 through F have their
most signficant bits equal to 1.

| w           | fun1(w) | fun2(w) |
| ----------- | ------- | ------- |
| 0x00000076  | ???     | ???     |
| 0x87654321  | ???     | ???     |
| 0x000000C9  | ???     | ???     |
| 0xEDBCBA987 | ???     | ???     |

## (b)

Describe in words the useful computation each of these functions performs.

## Answer

### (a)

| w           | fun1(w)      | fun2(w)      |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| 0x00000076  | `0x00000076` | `0x00000076` |
| 0x87654321  | `0x00000021` | `0x00000021` |
| 0x000000C9  | `0x000000C9` | `0xFFFFFFC9` |
| 0xEDBCBA987 | `0x00000087` | `0xFFFFFF87` |

### (b)

- `fun1` extracts a positive number corresponding to the lowest order byte of `w`
- `fun2` does the same as `fun1` but with sign extension, it will pad with `1`s if
  the lowest order byte is greater than or equal to `0x80 = 1000_0000 = 128`
  (the result will be a number between -128 and -127)
