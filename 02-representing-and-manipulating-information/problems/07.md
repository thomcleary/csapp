# Problem 7

What would be printed as a result of the following call to `show_bytes`?

```C
const char *s = "abcdef";
show_bytes((byte_pointer) s, strlen(s));
```

Note that letters 'a' through 'z' have ASCII codes `0x61` through `0x7A`

## Answer

`61 62 63 64 65 66`

(strlen does not include the terminating null character)
