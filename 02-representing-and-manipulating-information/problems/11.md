# Problem 11

Armed with the function `inplace_swap` from Problem 2.10, you decide to write
code that will reverse the elements of an array by swapping elements from opposite
ends of the array, working toward the middle.

You arrive at the following function

```C
void reverse_array(int a[], int cnt) {
  int first, last;
  for (first = 0, last = cnt - 1;
       first <= last;
       first++, last--)
       inplace_swap(&first[first], &a[last]);
}
```

When you apply your function to an array containing elements 1, 2, 3 and 4,
you find the array now has, as expected, elements 4, 3, 2 and 1. When you try it
on an array with elements 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, however, you are surprised to see that
the array no has elements 5, 4, 0, 2, and 1. In fact, you discover that the code
always works correctly on arrays of even length, but it sets the middle element to
0 whenever the array has odd length.

(a) For an array of odd length `cnt = 2k + 1`, what are the values of variables
`first` and `last` in the final iteration of function `reverse_array`?

(b) Why does this call to function `inplace_swap` set the array element to `0`?

(c) What simple modification to the code for `reverse_array` would eliminate
this problem?

## Answer

### (a)

- `cnt = 2k + 1`
- `k = 1`

| Iteration | `first` | `last` |
| --------- | ------- | ------ |
| 1         | 0       | 4      |
| 2         | 1       | 3      |
| 3         | 2       | 2      |

### (b)

Since on the last iteration pointers to the same element of `a` are passed to
`inplace_swap` which will xor both arguments resulting in:

- `*y = a[2] ^ a[2] = 0`
- `*x = a[2] ^ 0 = 0`
- `*y = 0 ^ 0 = 0`

Since the x and y args of `inplace_swap` both point to `a[2]`, `a[2]` ends up
being set to `0`.

### (c)

Change the loop condition from `<=` to `<` so that `inplace_swap` is not called
when `first` and `last` are the same element.
