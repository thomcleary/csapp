# Problem 6

Using `show_int` and `show_float`, we determine that the integer `3,510,593` has
hexadecimal representation `0x00359141`, while the floating-point number `3,510,593.0`
has hexadecimal representation `0x4A564504`.

(a) Write the binary representations of these two hexadecimal values.

(b) Shift these two strings relative to one another to maximize the number of
matching bits. How many bits match?

(c) What parts of the strings do not match?

## Answer

(a)

| type  | binary                                  |
| ----- | --------------------------------------- |
| int   | 0000_0000_0011_0101_1001_0001_0100_0001 |
| float | 0100_1010_0101_0110_0100_0101_0000_0100 |

(b)

| type  | shifted binary                         |
| ----- | -------------------------------------- |
| int   | 00000000001`101011001000101000001`     |
| float | \_\_010010100`101011001000101000001`00 |

21 bits match

(c)

The most significant bit of the integer values `1` does not match.
The float also has some higher order `1` bits that do not match the remaining
higher order `0` bits of the int value.
