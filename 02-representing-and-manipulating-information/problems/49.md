# Problem 49

### (a)

For a floating-point format with an n-bit fraction, give a formula for the smallest positive integer
that cannot be represented exactly (because it would require an (n + 1)-bit fraction to be exact).
Assume the exponent field size k is large enough that the range of representable exponents does
not provide a limitation for this problem

### (b)

What is the numeric value of this integer for single-precision format (n = 23)?

## Answer

### (a)

Solution:

- The number has binary representation 1, followed by n zeros, followed by 1, giving value 2n+1 + 1.

My explanations to explain further:

- For single precision floating point the precision is 2^-23 (n = -23)
- As this is the smallest increment that can be made when increasing the value
- As the exponent increases, this precision decreases (the gap between representable
  numbers becomes larger)
- `1 * 2^-23` < `2 * 2^-23` ...
- `23 * 2^-23 = 1`
- `24 * 2^-23 = 2` -> The smallest possible gap between representable numbers is now 2

### (b)

- `1_0000_0000_0000_0000_0000_0001`
- 2^24 + 1
- 16777216 + 1
- 16,777,217
