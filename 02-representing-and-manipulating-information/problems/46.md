# Problem 46

The imprecision of floating-point arithmetic can have disastrous effects.
On February 25, 1991, during the first Gulf War, an American Patriot Missile battery
in Dharan, Saudi Arabia, failed to intercept an incoming Iraqi Scud missile.
The Scud struck an American Army barracks and killed 28 soldiers.

The US General Accounting Office (GAO) conducted a detailed analysis of the failure
and determined that the underlying cause was an imprecision in a numeric calculation.
In this exercise, you will reproduce part of the GAO's analysis.

The Patriot system contains an internal clock, implemented as a counter that is
incremented every 0.1 seconds. To determine the time in seconds, the program would multiply
the value of this counter by a 24-bit quantity that was a fractional binary approximation to 1/10.
In particular, the binary representation of 1/10 is the nonterminating sequence 0.000110011[0011]...2,
where the portion in brackets is repeated indefinitely. The program approximated 0.1, as a value x,
by considering just the first 23 bits of the sequence to the right of the binary point:
x = 0.00011001100110011001100.

(See Problem 2.51 for a discussion of how they could have approximated 0.1 more precisely.)

## (a)

What is the binary representation of 0.1 – x?

## (b)

What is the approximate decimal value of 0.1 – x?

## (c)

The clock starts at 0 when the system is first powered up and keeps counting up from there.
In this case, the system had been running for around 100 hours. What was the difference between
the actual time and the time computed by the software?

## (d)

The system predicts where an incoming missile will appear based on its velocity and the time
of the last radar detection. Given that a Scud travels at around 2,000 meters per second,
how far off was its prediction?

Normally, a slight error in the absolute time reported by a clock reading would not affect
a tracking computation. Instead, it should depend on the relative time between two successive readings.
The problem was that the Patriot software had been upgraded to use a more accurate function
for reading time, but not all.

## Answer

### (a)

- 0.00011001100110011001100[1100]... - 0.00011001100110011001100
- 0.0000000000000000000000011001100[1100]...

### (b)

- 0.1 - 0.00011001100110011001100
- 0.1 - 2^-4 - 2^-5 - 2^-8 - 2^-9 - 2^-12 - 2^-13 - 2^-16 - 2^-17 - 2^-20 - 2^-21
- 0.1 - 1/16 - 1/32 - 1/256 - 1/512 - 1/4096 - 1/8192 - 1/65536 - 1/131072 - 1/1048576 - 1/2097152
- 0.1 - 0.09999990463256836
- 0.00000009536743164

From the solution:

- can be approximated by `2^-20 * (1/10)`
- 1/10 = 0.00011001100110011001100[1100]...
- residual = 0.0000000000000000000000011001100[1100]...
- that is, the residual is just (1/10) shifted to the right by 20 places
- hence `(1/10) * 2^-20` is equivalent to the residual

### (c)

- 100 hours = 6,000 minutes = 360,000 seconds = 3,600,000 tenths of a second
- 3.6 million clock increments = 3.6 \* (10^6)
- (3.6 \* (10^6)) \* Residual(0.1 - x)
- (3.6 \* (10^6)) \* (1/10 \* 2^-20)
- ~0.343 seconds difference between the actual time and the time computed by the software

### (d)

- 2000m \* 0.343 = ~686m
