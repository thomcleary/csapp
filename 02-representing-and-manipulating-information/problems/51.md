# Problem 51

We saw in Problem 2.46 that the Patriot missile software approximated 0.1 as
`x = 0.00011001100110011001100`. Suppose instead that they had used IEEE
round-to-even mode to determine an approximation `x'` to 0.1 with 23 bits to the right of
the binary point.

## (a)

What is the binary representation of `x'`

## (b)

What is the approximate decimal value of `x' - 0.1`

## (c)

How far off would the computed clock have been after 100 hours of operation?

## (d)

How far off would the program's prediction of the position of the Scud
missile have been?

## Answers

### (a)

Looking at the nonterminating sequence of 1/10

- 0.00011001100110011001100[1100]...

The bits to the right of the rounding position (23rd bit to the right of the binary point)
are 1, so a better aproximation would be to increment the value of `x` by 1

- `x'` = `0.00011001100110011001101`

### (b)

- `x' - 0.1` = `0.0000000000000000000000000[1100]`
- 2^-22 \* 1/10

### (c)

- 2^-22 \* 1/10 \* 100 \* 60 \* 60 \* 10 ~ 0.086 seconds

### (d)

- 0.086 \* 2000 ~ 171 metres
