# Problem 37

You are given the task of patching the vulnerability in the XDR code shown in
the aside on page 100 for the case where both data types `int` and `size_t` are 32
bits. You decide to eliminate the possibility of the multiplication overflowing by
computing the number of bytes to allocate using data type `uint64_t`. You replace
the original call to `malloc` (line 9) as follows

```C
uint64_t asize = ele_cnt * (uint64_t) ele_size;
void *result = malloc(asize);
```

Recall that argument to `malloc` has type `size_t`

## (a)

Does your code provide any improvement over the original?

## (b)

How would you change the code to eliminate the vulnerability?

## Answers

### (a)

No it does not, since the argument passed to `malloc` will be cast back
to a 32 bit unsigned integer in this case, as `size_t` is assumed to be that size
in this example. Meaning the result may still be truncated.

### (b)

You could check that multiplication will not cause overflow and
return `NULL` as if `malloc` had failed when `ele_cnt * ele_size`
would cause overflow.

```C
uint64_t required_size = ele_cnt * (uint64_t) ele_size;
size_t request_size = (size_t) required_size;
if (required_size != request_size) {
  /* Overflow must have occured. Abort operation */
  return NULL;
}
void *result = malloc(request_size);
if (result == NULL) {
  /* malloc failed */
  return NULL;
}
```
