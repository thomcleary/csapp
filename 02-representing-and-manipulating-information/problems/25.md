# Problem 25

Consider the following code that attempts to sum the elements of an array `a`, where
the number of elements is given by a parameter length:

```C
/* WARNING: This is buggy code */
float sum_elements(float a[], unsigned length) {
  int i;
  float result = 0;

  for (i = 0; i <= length-1; i++) {
    result += a[i];
  }

  return result;
}
```

When run with argument `length` equal to `0`, this code should return `0.0`.
Instead, it encounters a memory error. Explain why this happens. Show how this
code can be corrected.

## Answer

`length-1` in the for loop condition will be `UMAX` (unsigned max value) when `length` is `0`.
This will cause the access of `a` to be accessed with an invalid index on the next line.

To correct this code, use `i < length` as the loop condition.
