# Problem 19

Using the able you filled in when solving Problem 2.17, fill in the following table
describing function `T2U` (for 4 bits)

| x   | `T2U(x)` |
| --- | -------- |
| -8  | ???      |
| -3  | ???      |
| -2  | ???      |
| -1  | ???      |
| 0   | ???      |
| 5   | ???      |

## Answer

| x   | `T2U(x)`                    |
| --- | --------------------------- |
| -8  | `-8 = 1000 = 8 (unsigned)`  |
| -3  | `-3 = 1101 = 13 (unsigned)` |
| -2  | `-2 = 1110 = 14 (unsigned)` |
| -1  | `-1 = 1111 = 15 (unsigned)` |
| 0   | `0 = 0000 = 0 (unsigned)`   |
| 5   | `5 = 0101 = 5 (unsigned)`   |
