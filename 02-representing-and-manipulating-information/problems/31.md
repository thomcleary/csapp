# Problem 31

Youre coworker gets impatient with your analysis of the overflow conditions for
two's-complement addition and presents you with the following implementation
of `tadd_ok`

```C
/* Determine whether arguments can be added without overflow */
/* WARNING: This code is buggy */
int tadd_ok(int x, int y) {
  int sum = x + y;
  return (sum - x == y) && (sum - y == x);
}
```

You look at the code and laugh. Explain why.

## Answer

Two's complement addition forms an `abelian group`, and so the expression `(x+y)-x`
will always evaluate to `y` whether or not the addition overflows (`(x+y)-y` will always evaluate to `x`)
