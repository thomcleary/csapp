# Problem 32

You are assigned the task of writing code for a function `tsub_ok` with arguments
`x` and `y`, that will return 1 if computing `x-y` does not cause overflow. Having just
written code for Problem 2.30, you write the following:

```C
/* Determine whether arguments can be subtracted without overflow  */
/* WARNING: This code is buggy */
int tsub_ok(int x, int y) {
  return tadd_ok(x, -y);
}
```

For what values of `x` and `y` will this function give incorrect results?

(Writing a correct version of this function is left as an exercise, Problem 2.74)

## Answer

When `y` is `INT_MIN` the function will give incorrect values.

Multiplying `INT_MIN` by (-1) `-INT_MIN` results in just `INT_MIN`,
as the largest possible postive value representable by two's complement is
the absolute value of INT_MIN minus 1. `-INT_MIN` is 1 greater than this value
(when the bit vector is viewed as an unsigned integer) and results in
`-2^m == INT_MIN = -INT_MIN` where m is the word size.

- `tsub_ok(37, INT_MIN)` -> (expected 0 as INT_MIN - 37 produces negative overflow)
- `tadd_ok(37, -INT_MIN)` -> returns 1 (its ok to add 37 to INT_MIN)

- `tsub(-37, INT_MIN)` -> (expected 1 as INT_MIN - -37 is ok)
- `tadd_ok(-37, -INT_MIN)` -> returns 0 (its NOT ok to add -37 to INT_MIN, produces negative overflow)
