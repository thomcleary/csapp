# Problem 47

Consider a 5-bit floating point representation based on the IEEE floating point
format, with one sign bit, two exponent bits (k = 2), and two fraction bits (n = 2).

The exponent bias is `2^(2-1) - 1 = 1`.

The table that follows enumerates the entire nonnegative range for this 5-bit
floating point representation. Fill in the blank table entries using the following
directions:

- `e`: The value represented by considering the exponent field to be an unsigned integer
- `E`: The value of the exponent after biasing
- `2^E`: The numberic weight of the exponent
- `f`: The value of the fraction
- `M`: The value of the significand
- `2^E * M`: The (unreduced) fractional value of the number
- `V`: The reduced fractional value of the number
- `Decimal`: The decimal representation of the number

Express the values of `2^E`, `f`, `M`, `2^E * M` and `V` either as integers (when possible)
or as fractions of the form `x/y` where `y` is a power of 2. You need not fill in entries marked `x`
