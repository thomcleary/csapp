# Problem 40

For each of the following values of `K`, find ways to express `x * K` using only the
specified number of operations, where we consider both additions and subtractions
to have comparable cost. You may need to use some tricks beyond the simple
for A and B rules we have considered so far.

| K   | Shifts | Add/Subs | Expression |
| --- | ------ | -------- | ---------- |
| 6   | 2      | 1        | ???        |
| 31  | 1      | 1        | ???        |
| -6  | 2      | 1        | ???        |
| 55  | 2      | 2        | ???        |

## Answer

| K   | Shifts | Add/Subs | Expression                | Example                                                 |
| --- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 6   | 2      | 1        | `(x << 3) - (x << 1)`     | `4 * 6 = (4 << 3) - (4 << 1) = 32 - 8 = 24`             |
| 31  | 1      | 1        | `(x << 5) - x`            | `4 * 31 = (4 << 5) - 4) = 128 - 4 = 124`                |
| -6  | 2      | 1        | `(x << 1) - (x << 3)`     | `4 * -6 = (4 << 1) - (4 << 3) = 8 - 32 = -24`           |
| 55  | 2      | 2        | `(x << 6) - (x << 3) - x` | `4 * 55 = (4 << 6) - (4 << 3) - 4 = 256 - 32 - 4 = 220` |
