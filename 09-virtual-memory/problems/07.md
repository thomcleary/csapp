# Problem 7

Determine the minimum block size for each of the following combinations of
alignment requirements and block formats. Assumptions: Implicit free list,
zero-size payloads are not allowed, and headers and footers are stored in 4 byte words.

| Alignment   | Allocated block       | Free block        | Minimum block size (bytes) |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| Single word | Header and footer     | Header and footer | ???                        |
| Single word | Header, but no footer | Header and footer | ???                        |
| Double word | Header and footer     | Header and footer | ???                        |
| Double word | Header, but no footer | Header and footer | ???                        |

## Answer

| Alignment   | Allocated block       | Free block        | Minimum block size (bytes) |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| Single word | Header and footer     | Header and footer | 12 bytes                   |
| Single word | Header, but no footer | Header and footer | 8 bytes                    |
| Double word | Header and footer     | Header and footer | 16 bytes                   |
| Double word | Header, but no footer | Header and footer | 8 bytes                    |
