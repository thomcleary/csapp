# Problem 4

Show how the example memory system in Section 9.6.4 translates a virtual address into a physical address and access the cache. For the given virtual address, indicate the TLB entry accessed, physical address, and cache byte value returned. Indicate whether the TLB misses, whether a page fault occurs, and whether a cache miss occurs. If there is a cache miss, enter "-" for "Cache byte returned". If there is a page fault, enter "-" for "PPN" and leave parts C and D blank.

- (a) Virtual address: 0x03d7

## Answer

### Virtual address format

- 0x03d7
- 00 0011 1101 0111

| 13  | 12  | 11  | 10  | 9   | 8   | 7   | 6   | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   | 0   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   |

### Address translation

| Parameter         | Value |
| ----------------- | ----- |
| VPN               | 0xf   |
| TLB index         | 0x3   |
| TLB tag           | 0x3   |
| TLB hit? (Y/N)    | Y     |
| Page fault? (Y/N) | N     |
| PPN               | 0x0d  |

### Physical address format

- PPN: 0x0d
- PPO: VPO: 010111
- 1101 010111
- 0011 0101 0111

| 11  | 10  | 9   | 8   | 7   | 6   | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   | 0   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   |

### Physical memory reference

| Parameter           | Value |
| ------------------- | ----- |
| Byte offset         | 0x3   |
| Cache index         | 0x5   |
| Cache tag           | 0xd   |
| Cache hit? (Y/N)    | Y     |
| Cache byte returned | 0x1d  |
